Mozilla Brick packaged for use in Meteor projects.

Brick is a bundle of re-usable UI components built with [x-tags](http://www.x-tags.org/) for quickly and flexibly building mobile HTML5 apps. Brick adds new HTML tags- widgets that allow developers to express the structure of an application in a clearer, more concise manner.
